# From Packets to Predictions: A Practical Machine Learning Curriculum for Network Engineers

This repository contains a comprehensive, hands-on curriculum designed to bridge the gap between deep expertise in fixed access networking and the transformative power of modern AI. This is a strategic blueprint for software engineers to develop practical, production-grade skills in Machine Learning (ML) and Large Language Models (LLMs) by solving problems directly relevant to our domain.

## The Opportunity: The Next Generation of Network Intelligence

The future of network management is intelligent, automated, and predictive. The vast streams of telemetry data, traffic patterns, customer support tickets, and configuration files we manage are no longer just operational artifactsâ€”they are the raw material for building intelligent systems.

This curriculum moves beyond theory and focuses on a simple, powerful idea: learning by building. Instead of abstract tutorials, we will tackle 10 realistic, high-impact projects. We will learn to transform our data into actionable insights, moving from a reactive to a proactive approach in how we manage, optimize, and secure our networks.

## A Structured Learning Path

This is not a random collection of scripts but a structured learning path designed to build skills progressively. The curriculum is organized into three tiers, each building upon the last:

*   **Tier 1: Foundational Skills (Projects 1-3)**
    *   Master the fundamentals of data wrangling, feature engineering, and classic ML models (regression, classification, clustering). We'll build our core toolkit with `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `xgboost`, and learn the critical skill of model interpretation with `SHAP`.

*   **Tier 2: Intermediate Applications & LLMs (Projects 4-7)**
    *   Dive into more complex domains, including time-series forecasting with `Prophet`, and make our first foray into Natural Language Processing (NLP). We will use the `Hugging Face Transformers` and `LangChain` libraries to build our first LLM-powered applications for classification and automated report generation.

*   **Tier 3: Advanced Systems (Projects 8-10)**
    *   Tackle the most advanced and impactful use cases. We will explore network topology with `NetworkX`, build a powerful, custom-knowledge chatbot using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and create a self-learning agent for QoS optimization using **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** with `Gymnasium`.

## Key Skills You Will Master

By completing this curriculum, you and your team will gain hands-on proficiency in:

*   **Core Machine Learning:** Data Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, Model Training, and Evaluation.
*   **Supervised Learning:** Regression (XGBoost) and Classification (Random Forest).
*   **Unsupervised Learning:** Anomaly Detection (Isolation Forest).
*   **Time-Series Forecasting:** Prophet.
*   **NLP & Large Language Models:**
    *   Zero-Shot Classification and Text Generation with **Hugging Face Transformers**.
    *   Building LLM-powered workflows with **LangChain**.
    *   Grounding LLMs in custom data with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.
    *   **Prompt Engineering**.
*   **Model Explainability:** Unlocking the "why" behind predictions with **SHAP**.
*   **Advanced Topics:**
    *   Graph Analytics with **NetworkX**.
    *   Reinforcement Learning with **Gymnasium & Stable-Baselines3**.
*   **MLOps Foundations:** Creating reproducible projects, managing dependencies, and building simple UIs with `Gradio`.
