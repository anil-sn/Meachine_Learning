# ml-learning: Machine Learning Projects for Network Engineers

This repository is a practical, project-driven guide for **Network Engineers** looking to transition into Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

In today's rapidly evolving network landscape, AI/ML skills are becoming crucial for automation, optimization, and advanced security. This project provides a hands-on pathway to acquire these skills by focusing on **real-world networking problems solved with Machine Learning**.

## Project Focus: Learn ML by Doing

Our core approach is hands-on learning through a series of dedicated ML projects. Each project is designed to teach you fundamental ML concepts and algorithms directly applicable to network engineering. You'll gain practical experience in:

*   **Network Traffic Analysis:** Detecting anomalies, classifying traffic patterns.
*   **Predictive Maintenance:** Forecasting potential infrastructure failures.
*   **Resource Optimization:** Bandwidth forecasting, QoS (Quality of Service) improvements.
*   **Automated Troubleshooting:** Building intelligent chatbots and classification systems.

By working through these projects, you'll not only master ML techniques but also build a portfolio of solutions directly relevant to network operations.

## Why This Project for Network Engineers?

*   **Direct Relevance:** All projects are tailored to common networking challenges, making your learning immediately applicable.
*   **Bridge the Skill Gap:** Seamlessly connect your existing network knowledge with powerful ML methodologies.
*   **Future-Proof Your Career:** Acquire essential skills for the next generation of intelligent, autonomous networks.
*   **Practical Mastery:** Move beyond theory and develop tangible, deployable ML solutions.

## How to Get Started with the Projects

To begin your hands-on ML journey:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anil-sn/ml-learning.git
    cd ml-learning
    ```
2.  **Explore the `projects/` directory:** This is where all the step-by-step ML projects are located. Each subdirectory (e.g., `projects/001_Network_Traffic_Anomaly_Detection`) contains its own `readme.md` with project details, setup instructions, and guidance.
3.  **Review Prerequisites:** While the projects are practical, a basic understanding of Python and fundamental math concepts is beneficial. Consult the relevant sections within the project (e.g., `html/prerequisites.html` if you render the site) for guidance.
